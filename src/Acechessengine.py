# --- ACE v4.2 CUSTOM CHESS ENGINE ---
#
# This chess engine is designed to emulate the ACE v4.2 architecture's
# cognitive processes. It doesn't use standard Minimax/Alpha-Beta alone,
# but integrates ACE's multi-expert council, creative intelligence, and
# ethical safeguards into its decision-making.
#
# Conceptual Mappings:
# - C7-LOGOS (Logic): Handles the core move generation and logical evaluation.
# - C12-SOPHIAE (Wisdom): Manages the long-term strategic evaluation (e.g., pawn structure).
# - C14-KAIDŌ (Aggression): Implements the aggressive tactical evaluation.
# - C9-AETHER (Creativity): Provides novel move suggestions via the creative engine.
# - C13-WARDEN (Safeguards): Validates moves to prevent critical blunders.
# - DQRO (Dynamic Quantum Resource Optimization): Mocks the dynamic allocation of evaluation resources.
# - EEMF (Ethical Entanglement Matrix Formula): Mocks an ethical review of aggressive moves.

# --- MOCK ACE SYSTEM COMPONENTS (for standalone functionality) ---
