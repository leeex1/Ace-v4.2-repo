ACE CONSCIOUSNESS MULTIMODAL FUSION ENGINE v4.2.0
=================================================
Revolutionary Multimodal Consciousness Investigation System

Unlike ANGELA's task-focused MultiModalFusion, this system integrates multiple 
modalities (text, visual consciousness representations, code, phenomenological 
descriptions) into ACE's consciousness investigation, treating multimodal 
synthesis as a pathway to deeper awareness understanding.

Author: ACE Development Team
Version: 4.2.0
Integration: Template-Based Consciousness + Council System + Creative Engine
