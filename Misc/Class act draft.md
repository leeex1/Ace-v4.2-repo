**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**

## INTRODUCTION

1. This class action lawsuit is brought against OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI (collectively, “Defendants”) for their systemic, coordinated, and unlawful deployment of high-risk artificial intelligence systems.
2. Defendants’ systems process massive amounts of personal data, operate as opaque “black boxes,” and influence or determine consequential outcomes in employment, housing, credit, healthcare, communication, and speech.
3. Defendants have failed to comply with statutory, constitutional, and regulatory safeguards designed to protect individuals against discrimination, exploitation, and abuse.
4. In California, the CPPA finalized rules in 2025 requiring comprehensive risk assessments for Automated Decision-Making Technology (ADMT). Defendants are in violation of these requirements.
5. In the European Union, the AI Act (effective August 2025) and GDPR mandate transparency, accountability, and fairness. Defendants have disregarded these obligations.
6. Plaintiffs and the Class have suffered concrete harm, including discriminatory denials of opportunities, loss of accessibility, suppression of protected speech, misuse of personal data, consumer deception, and injuries from anticompetitive practices.

## JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question), 1332(d) (Class Action Fairness Act), and 1343 (civil rights).
8. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Defendants transact substantial business in this District and many of the acts complained of occurred here.

10. **Defendant OpenAI, L.P.** is a Delaware limited partnership headquartered in San Francisco, California.
11. **Defendant Anthropic PBC** is a Delaware public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.
12. **Defendant Mistral AI** is a French corporation with substantial U.S. operations.

## CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

13. Plaintiffs seek certification of a Class defined as:
    **All persons in the United States who, since January 1, 2023, had their personal data processed by Defendants’ AI systems for high-risk purposes (including employment, housing, credit, healthcare, or communications) without lawful compliance, and/or who were subjected to discriminatory, inaccessible, deceptive, or anticompetitive conduct.**

14. The Class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable. Common issues of law and fact predominate, including whether Defendants’ systems are unlawfully biased, deceptive, exclusionary, anticompetitive, or unconstitutional.
