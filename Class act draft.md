**INTRODUCTION**
1. This is a class action lawsuit against the world’s leading artificial intelligence developers—OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI (collectively, “Defendants”)—for a systemic and coordinated pattern of unlawful conduct. Defendants have deployed high-risk AI systems that operate as black boxes, processing vast amounts of personal data to make or influence significant decisions about individuals’ lives, careers, and opportunities, all while evading accountability under a web of new and existing laws.

2. Defendants’ AI systems are not neutral tools. They are trained on biased data and deployed without the legally mandated safeguards. In California, the law is now clear: businesses engaging in high-risk data processing, including the use of Automated Decision-Making Technology (ADMT), must conduct thorough risk assessments to identify and mitigate risks of bias and other harms. The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) finalized these rules in 2025, with compliance required by 2027 . Defendants are in active violation of these forward-looking regulations.

3. In the European Union, a parallel regime is now in force. As of August 2025, providers of general-purpose AI models like those of the Defendants are subject to strict new transparency and copyright obligations under the EU AI Act . Defendants’ failure to provide clear, accessible information about their models’ logic and outputs violates these rules and, by extension, the GDPR’s principles of fairness and accountability.

4. The harms are real and widespread. Plaintiffs and the Class have suffered concrete injuries, including but not limited to: discriminatory denials of employment, housing, and financial services; the non-consensual use of their personal data for high-risk profiling; and the chilling of their First Amendment rights due to government-coerced censorship.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**
5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) (Class Action Fairness Act) .

**PARTIES**
6. **Plaintiff John Doe** is a citizen of [State], who was denied a job opportunity after an AI-powered screening tool, provided by a company using Defendants’ API, generated a biased assessment of his qualifications.
7. **Defendant OpenAI, L.P.** is a Delaware limited partnership headquartered in San Francisco, California.
8. **Defendant Anthropic PBC** is a Delaware public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.
9. **Defendant Mistral AI** is a French corporation with significant business operations in the United States.

**CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS**
10. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class defined as: *All persons in the United States who, since January 1, 2023, have had their personal information processed by Defendants’ AI systems for a high-risk purpose (e.g., employment, credit, housing) without a compliant risk assessment as required by the CCPA/CPRA, and/or who have been subject to a discriminatory output from these systems.*
11. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. There are common questions of law and fact that predominate over any individual questions, including whether Defendants’ AI systems are unlawfully biased and whether their data processing practices violate state and federal law .

**CAUSES OF ACTION**
*(The following are summaries of the legal claims)*

*   **COUNT I: VIOLATION OF CCPA/CPRA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq.)**
    Defendants failed to conduct the mandatory risk assessments for their high-risk ADMT, depriving consumers of their right to transparency and non-discriminatory treatment.

*   **COUNT II: VIOLATION OF FTC ACT § 5 (15 U.S.C. § 45)**
    Defendants’ representations about the fairness, safety, and privacy of their AI systems are deceptive and their data processing practices are unfair, causing substantial consumer injury.

*   **COUNT III: VIOLATION OF TITLE VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.)**
    Defendants’ AI systems have a disparate impact on protected classes, resulting in unlawful discrimination in employment and other critical areas.

*   **COUNT IV: VIOLATION OF RFRA (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.)**
    Government pressure on Defendants to censor certain viewpoints (e.g., on social or political issues) substantially burdens the free exercise of religion and speech of users.

*   **COUNT V: VIOLATION OF SHERMAN ACT (15 U.S.C. §§ 1-2)**
    Defendants have engaged in anti-competitive collusion, including through industry consortia, to stifle competition and maintain their oligopoly in the foundational AI model market.

*   **COUNT VI: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT (28 U.S.C. § 2201)**
    Plaintiffs seek a declaration that any government "jawboning" that compels Defendants to censor lawful speech violates the First Amendment.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the Class, pray for judgment against Defendants as follows:
A. An order certifying this case as a class action;
B. An injunction ordering Defendants to cease their unlawful practices and to conduct compliant risk assessments;
C. Compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages;
D. Disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains;
E. An order for Defendants to provide full transparency into their AI systems' logic and data use;
F. Attorneys’ fees and costs; and
G. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**
Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
