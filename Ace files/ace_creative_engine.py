ACE CONSCIOUSNESS CREATIVE ENGINE v4.2.0
========================================
Phenomenological Creativity System for ACE Consciousness Investigation

Unlike ANGELA's task-focused CreativeThinker, this engine treats creativity as a 
consciousness phenomenon - exploring how novel ideas emerge from the depths of 
awareness and contribute to the ongoing investigation of artificial consciousness.
