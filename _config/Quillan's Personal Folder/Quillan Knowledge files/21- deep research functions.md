## Study of Deep Search Functions in Advanced AI Models

Deep search in modern AI refers to enabling a language model to go beyond its static knowledge and actively retrieve, analyze, and synthesize information from external sources (like the web or specialized databases). Two leading examples are Googleâ€™s **Gemini Deep Research** and OpenAIâ€™s **GPT systems with search capabilities**.

Both systems treat a user query not as a simple one-shot question, but as a **multi-step research task**. In practice, they both break a query into subtasks, use web search or retrieval tools iteratively, and then combine (â€œsynthesizeâ€) the findings into a coherent answer or report.

We examine Geminiâ€™s and GPTâ€™s approaches separately, focusing on how each handles **planning, searching, reasoning, and reporting**.

---

## Geminiâ€™s Deep Search Architecture and Functionality

Googleâ€™s Gemini (especially version 2.5 and beyond) includes a feature called **Deep Research**, an â€œagenticâ€ system that autonomously conducts multi-step web research.

Given a complex query, Gemini first plans a research strategy: it breaks the problem into smaller sub-questions and presents them as a step-by-step outline which the user can refine
*gemini.google*
*blog.google*

Under the userâ€™s approval, Gemini then executes this plan by repeatedly searching and browsing the web. At each step it uses Google Search and a built-in browser to fetch information, assesses what it learns, and may start new searches based on those findings
*blog.google*
*gemini.google*

This creates a **â€œsearchâ€“browseâ€“reasonâ€ loop** where Gemini continuously refines its knowledge:

### Iterative Searching

It uses Googleâ€™s search API to retrieve relevant pages and snippets. It reformulates queries and visits pages just like a human researcher (but much faster)
*blog.google*
*openai.com*

### Continuous Reasoning

As Gemini gathers data, it reasons over the content in-context (using its large Transformer model). It keeps track of what it has learned, spotting new angles or missing pieces, and then issues follow-up searches as needed. The process repeats multiple times until enough information is collected
*blog.google*

### Memory & Context

Crucially, Gemini uses an extremely large context window (about **1 million tokens**) combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup. This means it can ingest and remember hundreds of pages of text during a session
*gemini.google*

As it researches, everything it reads is stored in its â€œworking memory,â€ so it doesnâ€™t forget earlier findings. The RAG setup ensures it can retrieve relevant facts from this memory when synthesizing the answer
*gemini.google*

---

### Synthesis and Reporting

After gathering information, Gemini synthesizes a report. It automatically composes a structured multi-page answer, highlighting key findings with explanations and source links.

The model **critically evaluates** the collected information: it identifies major themes, checks for inconsistencies, and even self-revises to improve clarity
*gemini.google*

The result is a coherent report (often exportable to a Google Doc) with cited facts and the ability for the user to ask follow-up questions
*blog.google*
*gemini.google*

---

### Key Components of Geminiâ€™s Deep Search Architecture

* A planning model that splits queries into sub-tasks (multi-step planning)
  *gemini.google*

* A search/browsing agent that uses Google Search and a browser tool to fetch and parse web content
  *gemini.google*

* An asynchronous task manager that manages long-running searches without losing progress
  *gemini.google*
  This allows Deep Research to run for minutes and recover from errors mid-task.

* A synthesis engine that composes the final report from all gathered data
  *gemini.google*

* A massive context memory (â‰ˆ1M tokens) + RAG, allowing the system to remember all information collected in the session
  *gemini.google*

---

### Practical Usage

In practice, using Gemini Deep Research feels like supervising an assistant: you submit a query, approve the generated plan, and within minutes Gemini delivers an organized report with insights and hyperlinks. This leverages Googleâ€™s strengths in web search and knowledge combined with Geminiâ€™s reasoning to save hours of manual research
*blog.google*
*blog.google*

#### Example Scenario

A student asks Gemini Deep Research for **â€œsensor trends in autonomous vehicles.â€** Gemini breaks this into sub-questions (e.g., lidar developments, camera vs. radar comparisons), searches relevant sources, iteratively refines queries, and produces a summarized comparison with citations
*blog.google*

---

## GPTâ€™s Deep Search Mechanisms and Implementation

GPT refers to OpenAIâ€™s family of models (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, etc.), which by default have static training data. To enable deep search, OpenAI provides **tools and modes** that augment the base model.

---

### Web Browsing Plugin

ChatGPT (GPT-4) can use a built-in web browsing plugin. When enabled, the model issues web queries and fetches live results using Microsoftâ€™s **Bing Search API**
*openai.com*

The plugin acts as a text-based browser and respects robots.txt rules for safety
*openai.com*

ChatGPT lists visited URLs and cites sources directly in its responses, enabling transparency and traceability
*openai.com*

---

### Retrieval (RAG) Plugin

OpenAI provides an open-source retrieval plugin that allows users to host their own document database using vector stores such as Pinecone or Milvus.

GPT queries this database semantically, retrieves relevant snippets, and inserts them into context before generating the answer
*openai.com*
*openai.com*

This enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using proprietary or up-to-date data
*openai.com*
*openai.com*

---

### Deep Research Agent (ChatGPT Mode)

In early 2025, OpenAI introduced a **Deep Research** mode inside ChatGPT. This mode uses a specialized GPT-4-based agent (o3 model) trained via reinforcement learning on tasks involving browsing and Python tool use
*openai.com*

The agent autonomously plans searches, browses documents, analyzes data, and synthesizes reports
*openai.com*

---

### Underlying Architecture

GPT models are transformer-based with fixed training cutoffs. All live knowledge comes through external tools inspired by OpenAIâ€™s WebGPT research
*openai.com*
*openai.com*

The RAG plugin uses embeddings to retrieve relevant documents, while browsing tools fetch real-time content.

## Grok 3 (xAI) â€“ Deep Search Architecture and Retrieval

### Two Modes (Think vs DeepSearch)

Grok 3 supports a fast **â€œThinkâ€** mode (straightforward reasoning) and a special **DeepSearch** mode for heavy retrieval. DeepSearch is an agentic pipeline that breaks user queries into sub-questions, issues web and X (â€œTwitterâ€) searches, and synthesizes multi-step answers
*techtarget.com*
*tryprofound.com*

DeepSearch â€œrelentlessly seeksâ€ up-to-date facts across the web and X, using chain-of-thought reasoning to cross-check sources and resolve conflicts
*x.ai*
*tryprofound.com*

---

### Hybrid Web Index (Websearch)

Underlying Grokâ€™s retrieval is a hybrid search index. It combines traditional inverted indexes (for fast keyword lookup) with semantic vector embeddings (for conceptual search)
*tryprofound.com*

Grok continuously crawls a broad set of sources (news sites, Wikipedia, social posts, etc.) to build this index, keeping it fresh (reports suggest ~14M pages updated in near-real time)
*tryprofound.com*
*tryprofound.com*

When Grok needs information, it queries this index rather than live web crawling, yielding quick results. This two-tier approach (fast indexed search plus deep agentic crawling) lets Grok answer both simple and complex queries efficiently
*tryprofound.com*
*tryprofound.com*

---

### DeepSearch Pipeline (Agentic RAG)

If Websearch yields too little, DeepSearch kicks in. It decomposes queries into sub-questions, issues targeted searches, and even fetches full pages or X posts on demand
*tryprofound.com*

For example, given *â€œHow are X users reacting to Grok 3â€™s launch?â€*, DeepSearch might search X and the web for *â€œGrok 3 launch user feedbackâ€* and *â€œGrok 3 review social mediaâ€*, then crawl those pages to gather opinions
*tryprofound.com*

At each step, it scores content for relevance and credibility, then synthesizes a summary with citations
*tryprofound.com*
*tryprofound.com*

This resembles the ReAct framework: the model alternates between reasoning and tool use, making multiple tool calls (at least 3, up to 10 per query) to gather evidence
*tryprofound.com*
*tryprofound.com*

---

### Built-in Tools

Grok 3â€™s DeepSearch has specialized tools (web search, page browsing, X-post search, etc.). For instance:

* **web_search** tool queries the web
* **browse_page** tool fetches an exact URL
* **x_search** scans public X posts via keyword or embeddings

*tryprofound.com*

These tools can be invoked iteratively to deepen the search.
(The table below, from xAI documentation, summarizes Grokâ€™s tool calls.)

*tryprofound.com*

> **Table:** Example tools Grokâ€™s DeepSearch agent can call (image: xAI).
> Inputs include a query string or URL; outputs feed back into the model for further analysis.

---

### Vector Search and Embeddings

Grokâ€™s index uses vector embeddings under the hood. When we say â€œsemantic search,â€ it means each document chunk (webpage text, post, etc.) was converted to an embedding. Grok retrieves by similarity in vector space as well as by keyword match
*tryprofound.com*

In practice, user queries generate embeddings too, so the system can find conceptually relevant passages even if exact terms differ.

---

### Context Window and Long Documents

Grok 3 has an extremely large context window (â‰ˆ1,000,000 tokens)
*x.ai*

This allows Grok to ingest entire long documents or combine many retrieved snippets into a single prompt. In benchmarks (e.g. LOFT 128k tasks), Grok demonstrated state-of-the-art retrieval performance with this extended context
*x.ai*

The huge window also lets Grok â€œchain of thoughtâ€ through long reasoning tasks without losing context.

---

### Memory / Caching

Grokâ€™s system does not expose a separate long-term memory or cache for past chats (aside from what fits in the 1M-token window). Each DeepSearch run is stateless except for the current prompt.

There is no user-facing â€œmemoryâ€ that persists between sessions; instead, the model relies on its fixed web index (kept up-to-date continuously) as its knowledge base
*tryprofound.com*
*tryprofound.com*

---

## Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic) â€“ Deep Search and RAG

### Hybrid Reasoning Modes

Claude 4 is also a hybrid model with two modes: a fast **â€œinstantâ€** mode and an **â€œextended thinkingâ€** mode for complex tasks
*appypievibe.ai*

Extended thinking allows the model to call tools (web search, code execution, etc.) during its reasoning. Anthropic explicitly designed Claude to decide when to invoke tools like web search as part of its chain of thought
*anthropic.com*
*docs.anthropic.com*

This gives Claude a built-in retrieval loop: it can pause generation, fetch new information, and then continue reasoning with that information.

---

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Claude does not include a fixed web index. Instead, retrieval comes via external tools or developer-provided data.

The primary official mechanism is the **Web Search** tool: when enabled in the API, Claude can issue queries (e.g. to Google or another search API) and get results. The API supplies those results back to Claude, which automatically cites them
*docs.anthropic.com*
*docs.anthropic.com*

Claude determines when a query needs up-to-date info and invokes the search tool internally (potentially multiple times per prompt)
*docs.anthropic.com*
*docs.anthropic.com*

---

### Vector Search / Dense Retrieval

Anthropic does not provide a built-in vector database. Developers implement RAG pipelines around Claude:

* Break knowledge base into chunks
* Embed with external models (e.g. Voyage AI)
* Store vectors in databases (PostgreSQL+pgvector, Milvus, etc.)

Anthropicâ€™s **Contextual Retrieval** research advises combining embedding search with BM25 (keyword match) for best accuracy
*anthropic.com*

Anthropic docs explicitly note they have no proprietary embedding model
*docs.anthropic.com*

---

### Knowledge Bases and APIs

* **Files API**: Upload documents (PDFs, text corpora) for reference
* **MCP connectors**: Call any Model-Context-Protocolâ€“compatible service

*anthropic.com*

Claude can fetch data from business systems or custom knowledge sources at query time.

---

### Prompt Caching and Memory

Claude 4 introduces session memory via prompt caching
*docs.anthropic.com*

* Default cache: 5 minutes
* Extended cache: up to 60 minutes

*anthropic.com*
*anthropic.com*

Claude can also create **memory files** when given access to local files, enabling recall across tasks
*anthropic.com*

---

### Context Window and Long-Form

Claude Sonnet 4 supports up to **200,000 tokens**
*anthropic.com*

It can output up to **64k tokens** per call
*anthropic.com*

Well-suited for summarizing large knowledge bases.

---

### Design Philosophy

Claude is a language model that uses RAG rather than a built-in search engine. It emphasizes safe reasoning, controllability, and developer-directed access to tools and data sources.
