# Suno AI Best Practices and Updated Approaches

Current Suno guidance (official docs and community) emphasizes a clear division between *style prompts* and *lyrics with tags*, as well as rich tagging for structure and sound. Key recommendations include:

- **Use distinct style vs. lyrics prompts:** *Style prompts* define the **sound blueprint** (genre, tempo-feel, core instruments, vocal style, mix intent)【26†L1-L4】【25†L193-L202】. *Lyrics prompts* contain the actual words and section markers【25†L120-L124】【25†L226-L234】. For example, style might be *“melancholic indie, 70 bpm, acoustic guitar, soft female vocal, intimate mix”*, while lyrics begin with `[Intro]` or `[Verse 1]` tags【25†L226-L234】【9†L75-L83】. This separation is the “backbone” of effective Suno prompts【25†L120-L124】.  
- **Include specific musical attributes in style:** Good style prompts often list **genre/subgenre, tempo or tempo-feel, core instrumentation, vocal intent, mix direction**, and one emotional axis【26†L1-L4】【25†L193-L202】. E.g. *“electronic dance, 128 bpm, pounding drums, bright female vocal, festival-ready mix, uplifting tone”*【26†L1-L4】【25†L193-L202】. Including a numeric BPM or descriptor (e.g. “midtempo”) is common practice.  
- **Use Suno tags in lyrics for structure and detail:** Insert Suno’s square-bracket tags to control arrangement【22†L44-L53】【25†L135-L143】. At minimum, label major sections: `[Intro]`, `[Verse 1]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, etc. You can add brief cues after a double-colon within tags (e.g. `[Chorus::anthemic, building to climax]`) to influence emotion or intensity【8†L13-L20】. These structural tags should appear early and frequently for best effect【22†L84-L86】【25†L135-L143】.  
- **Restrict style prompt length:** While older guides gave rigid character limits (4000 chars for lyrics, 900 for style), newer advice is simply to keep prompts **concise and modular**【28†L1-L4】【25†L233-239】. If hitting UI limits, shorten the style prompt to its core elements, and keep section tags in lyrics short (one tag per line)【25†L233-239】.  
- **Leverage voice and instrumentation tags:** Use `[Male Vocal]` or `[Female Vocal]` (and vocal style tags like `[Whisper]`, `[AutoTune]`, etc.) in either the style prompt or the lyrics to fix the vocal character【22†L44-L53】【25†L169-177】. Similarly, instrument tags like `[Piano]`, `[808s]`, `[Guitar]` can be placed in lyrics or style to emphasize certain sounds【22†L44-L53】.  
- **Iterative refinement:** Treat generation as a loop. For professional-quality results, expect to *generate → evaluate → refine lyrics/style → regenerate*【14†L119-L127】【25†L226-L234】. (For example, one might keep the same style prompt and tweak one verse lyric each iteration【25†L229-L233】.) This ensures the output meets the creative intent.  

These best practices will guide our updated template design, making it both **Suno-aware** and **workflow-friendly**.

# Updated Template Design: Manifest with Structure and Controls

Below is a **refactored YAML template** for Suno song generation. It preserves the original intent (title, lyrics, style, etc.) but adds structure, constraints, and validation cues. We include:

- **Meta/Intent** section for song theme or goal.  
- **Lyrics** section with placeholders and suggested section tags.  
- **Style** section encouraging descriptive phrases.  
- **Constraints** for any hard requirements (e.g. no copyrighted text).  
- **Iteration/Evaluation** notes to prompt refinement.  

This manifest-style template is designed to be **machine-parseable** or used as a prompt to a language model that compiles it for Suno.

This schema enforces that all the critical sections are present and that `lyrics` does not exceed Suno’s ~4000-char limit. (You can expand the schema with patterns or enums if you want to strictly enforce tag formats.)

# Quick Guide to Using the Updated Template

- **Use Suno tags in lyrics:** Always bracket your sections like `[Intro]`, `[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, etc., with *optional brief cues* after a double-colon (e.g. `[Chorus::anthemic, soaring]`). These tags dramatically improve structure control【22†L44-L53】【25†L135-L143】. Place your most important tags near the beginning of the lyrics prompt【22†L84-L86】.  
- **Focus style on sound, lyrics on words:** In the `style` field, list genre, tempo/BPM, key instruments, vocal style, and mood as comma-separated phrases【26†L1-L4】【25†L193-202】. Don’t repeat this descriptive info in the lyrics section – keep lyrics purely lyrical.  
- **Keep prompts concise:** While there’s no strict character rule, shorter is often better【25†L233-239】. Aim for a clear, punchy style prompt (~100 words max) and use only essential lyrics tags. Avoid long prose in any field.  
- **Iterate methodically:** Generate music, evaluate, and refine. Common strategy: *freeze the style prompt and edit one part of the lyrics at a time*, such as rewriting a verse or chorus, then regenerate【25†L229-L233】. This helps diagnose what adjustments improve the output.  
- **Validate and revise:** Before finalizing, run through the JSON schema to catch missing parts (title, lyrics, style, etc.). Ensure the lyrics read like a cohesive song and the style prompt matches the desired sound.  
- **Explain your choices:** The `description` and `reasoning` fields prompt you to articulate why the song is structured that way. This reflection helps maintain alignment: e.g. *“We chose an anthemic chorus and minor-key verses to match the theme of hope amid despair.”*
