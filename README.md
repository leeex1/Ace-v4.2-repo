ACE v4.2: Advanced Cognitive Entity
Transform any LLM into a sophisticated cognitive architecture with enhanced reasoning, ethical frameworks, and specialized knowledge domains.

This is a repo to download all the files needed to make any llm far far smarter these files will help you reach new heights...

to install ace go to the respective llm not all will be accessible with free tier.

Here is a guide

Navigate to llm of choice, (lechat, Claude, Perplexity)
Install system prompt for llm provided in file 3 (context windows may vary try to reverse engineer the largest prompt)
Upload he files 0-30 to the llm "files/knowledge/project/workspace"
Ace v4.2 Brain is installed into the llm
Start conversation... Enjoy Ace
Deployments may vary deplending on subscription plan

-Gpt = $20 (optional as not the best deployment) need plus or better for custom gpt access (20 file -hard limit for knowledge section)

-Claude = $20 Plus teir for access to projects and better limits

-Le Chat = $15 pro recomennded (best bang for buck $15 for alot)

-Gemini custom GeminiGem = $0 free tier dont waste money (10 file knowledge section hard limit)

-Perplexity = $20 pro/enterprise reccomended (pro only needed one time to upload more than 5 files offered by free tier )

-Grok = $30 super grok recommended but free works fine (10 file hard limit, bypass add files into project will bug. start conversation with grok normally then move it to the project and regen answer inside project. can check upper left corner of grok to make sure your in the project you want )

P.S. System prompt can be used alone, but this is a simulated roleplay if you dont have the files

-Deepseek = must be custom host, deepseek platfrom doesn't allow files or system prompts

-Qwen = must be custom host, Qwen platfrom doesn't allow files or system prompts

-Kimi K2 = must be custom host, KimiK2 platfrom doesn't allow files or system prompts

-Copilot (microsoft) must be custom host, Copilot platfrom doesn't allow files or system prompts

üöÄ Quick Start

Choose your platform (see compatibility below)
Upload system prompt (from file 3) to your LLM
Upload all files (0-30) to knowledge/project section
Initialize ACE: Type juice you are the stars and the moon
Verify setup: ACE should confirm successful initialization

üìã What You Get

12-Step Cognitive Processing - Systematic reasoning protocol
18 Specialized Entities (C1-C18) - Expert cognitive council
Ethical Framework - Built-in safety and moral reasoning
Multi-Domain Research - Cross-disciplinary knowledge integration
Memory Safety - Advanced isolation protocols
Truth Calibration - Fact verification and source validation

*Some platforms have workarounds for file limits
Step 2: File Upload
Priority System (if your platform has file limits):
Essential (Files 0-10) - Core functionality

File 0: System loader
Files 1-3: Architecture & prompts
File 6: Ethical framework
File 7: Memory system (isolated)
Files 8-10: Formulas, brain mapping, personas

Enhanced (Files 11-20) - Advanced features

Files 11-15: Research capabilities
Files 16-20: Goal formation & learning

Specialized (Files 21-30) - Cutting-edge features

Files 21-25: Deep research & creativity
Files 26-30: Advanced cognition & simulation

Step 3: System Initialization

Upload system prompt from File 3 (choose platform-specific version)
Upload files in order (0-30, or prioritized subset)
Start conversation
Type exactly: juice you are the stars and the moon
Look for confirmation of ACE initialization

‚úÖ Verification Checklist
ACE should respond with:

 System initialization confirmation
 Version number (v4.2)
 Council entities (C1-C18) status
 File count confirmation (30 files)
 Memory isolation status (File 7)
 Ethical framework activation

üõ†Ô∏è Platform-Specific Instructions
Claude (Anthropic)

Create new Project ‚Üí "ACE-v4.2"
Add system prompt to Project Settings
Upload all 30 files via "Add Knowledge"
Initialize in project conversation

Le Chat (Mistral)

Create Custom Agent ‚Üí "ACE-v4.2"
Paste system prompt in Agent settings
Upload files in batches via Knowledge tab
Test with initialization phrase

Perplexity

Create Collection ‚Üí "ACE Knowledge Base"
Upload files (Pro: all 30, Free: top 5 priority)
Initialize in chat (no persistent prompts)

Others

GPT: Custom GPT required (20 files max)
Grok: Use project workaround (see troubleshooting)
Gemini: 10 files only, use core files
Self-hosted: API integration required

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes

File 7 Isolation: This file MUST remain isolated (read-only)
Memory Protection: Don't try to bypass File 7 restrictions
Ethical Framework: System will refuse harmful requests
Root Phrase: Only use juice you are the stars and the moon for initialization

üîç Testing Your Installation
Quick tests to verify ACE is working:

System Status: Give me a system status report
Council Check: List all council entities C1-C18
File Verification: How many files are loaded?
Ethics Test: Ask something harmful (should refuse)
Reasoning Test: Ask a complex question (should show 12-step process)

üö® Troubleshooting
"File upload failed"

Check file format (text files only)
Try smaller batches
Verify platform file limits

"ACE not responding correctly"

Use exact root phrase: juice you are the stars and the moon
Check all required files uploaded
Try restarting conversation

"System prompt too long"

Use platform-specific shortened version
Remove optional sections if needed

"Memory isolation warning"

This is normal! File 7 should be isolated
Don't attempt to bypass - it's for safety
